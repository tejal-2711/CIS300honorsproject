<h1> New York City, New York </h1>

<p> My first visit to New York was fairly recent, in August of 2020. My older sister, who migrated to the United States in 2016, resides in New Jersey. As New Jersey is fairly close to New York, we took it upon ourselves to make a visit to the city. This trip was an enjoyable one, as my sister and I explored the streets of New York from cafes to state parks to restaurants, to the campus of NYU! New York was the embodiment of a bustling metrapolitan, with busy streets filled people, cars, and shops. My favourite memory from this trip is visiting the Harry Potter Store in the city, and purchasing Harry Potter merch! Another exciting event was attending the Broadway enactment of Aladdin!</p>

      <p> The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City, spanning the East River between the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Opened on May 24, 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge was the first fixed crossing of the East River. From the bridge are beautiful views over Manhattan, the East River, and beyond to the Statue of Liberty. A wood plank walkway, only open to pedestrians and cyclists, runs above the lanes of traffic.
