<h1> Agra, India </h1>

<p> My visit to Agra, India took place when I was in middle school, and was travelling through India with my family. My family and I were visiting my aunt in New Delhi, when my aunt decided to take us on a trip to Agra to witness one of the world's seven wonders, Taj Mahal. We travelled to Agra by road, as my uncle drove us from New Delhi to Agra. We reached Taj Mahal through the bustling streets of Agra and the fog building up from the cold weather. Dressed in thick coats and sweaters to beat the cold winters, my family and I made our way to the famous Taj Mahal! We toured around the famous monument, and the fort opposite Taj Mahal.</p>
