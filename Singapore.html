<h1> Singapore </h1>

<p> My stay in Singapore was not a travel visit, but was during the time I resided there! I lived in Singapore with my family throughout my high school. My stay in Singapore was a memorable experience, one where I experienced living in a new city, and found new and lasting friendships. Other than being a great place for residence and schooling, Singapore has a multitude of tourist attractions, many of which I visited during my stay in the city. Some of these include Universal Studios Singapore, Sentosa beaches, Jewel Changi International Airport, East Coast Beach, Changi Beach, and Marina Bay Sands! All of these places were beautiful and enjoyable. Singapore is home to beaches, malls, nature parks, and great food!</p>
