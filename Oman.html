<h1> Oman </h1>

<p> My visit to Oman during the Summer of 2022 was a unique and memorable one. While staying with my parents at Muscat, we decided to tour the famous tourist spots in Oman. Oman is known for its beautiful nature spots and rich culture. We visited spots on the outskirts of Muscat such as Mattrah. We made a trip down to the scenic and picturesque island of Salalah. Our trips around spots in Oman involved a lot of driving through scenic routes, and enjoying the relaxed ennvironment and the escape from the crowd and fast-paced environment of metrapolitan cities.</p>

<h2> Places to Visit in Oman </h2>
<div id="section">
      <h3><center>Salalah</center></h3>
      <p> Salalah is the capital city of southern Oman's Dhofar province. It's known for its banana plantations, Arabian Sea beaches, green landscape and seasonal waterfalls. Salalah is very cloudy and foggy during the monsoon months starting from July till August, even though it has relatively little rain falls. Salalah is very picturesque and pleasant, especially during the monsoon, when people make trips to Salalah to get away from the hot and humid weather in the cities. There are many waterfalls to visit, such as at Wadi Darbat, Ain Athum, Ain Tubrook, and Ain Khor.

      <h3><center>Jebel Akhdar</center></h3>
      <p>The Jebel Akhdar or Al Jabal Al Akhdar, is part of Al Hajar Mountains range in Ad Dakhiliyah Governorate of Oman. It rises to a height of 2,980 m and encompasses the Saiq Plateau at 2,000 m above sea level.The region is a two-hour drive from Omanâ€™s capital of Muscat, and is located in a remote location and rugged terrain. Those who make the trek there can glimpse authentic Omani villages and take in sweeping mountain views.A guided walk is a good way to see both the villages and the hidden gardens and orchards.
