<h1> Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia </h1>

<p> My visit to Kuala Lumpur took place during my high school days, when my family and I resided in Singapore. My family and I made a couple of trips down to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, as the city was merely an hour away from Singapore through a flight. Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, is a city bustling with residents and tourists. Kuala Lumpur has a hot and humid weather for most of the year, and wittnesses heavy rains during the monsoon season. The monsoon season heightens the beauty of Kuala Lumpur's scenic natural environment. Unlike a lot of metrapolitan cities, Kuala Lumpur is filled with nature, with road and pathways decoarated with trees and flowers that bloom during the monsoon season. KL is also home to multiple tourist attractions, some of which I stopped by durig my visits such as the Petronas twin towers, KL bird park, Little India, and Batu Caves.</p>
